Given a partially filled 9x9 Sudoku board, our task is to complete the board while ensuring the following rules are met:

Each row must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition.

Each column must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition.

Each 3x3 subgrid must contain the numbers 1-9 without repetition.

The Sudoku board is represented as a 9x9 matrix, where empty cells are denoted by 0s. The goal is to fill these empty cells while maintaining the validity of the Sudoku rules.
